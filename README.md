# react-native-training

This is an expo react native application i'm currently doing as a training. It's a twitter clone.
It uses a [backend](https://github.com/dipietronicolas/json-server) i've made with mocked data, to run this project you are going to have this backend downloaded and running. 

## Installation

To run this project you need the LTS version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en), then follow next steps inside the root folder. 


```bash
npm install
npm start
```

These steps will open metro dialog, choose if you want to open on web, ios or android simulator. For ios you need to install [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and for android you need [android-studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=es-419). You can just run it web on your browser if you don't have any of those.
